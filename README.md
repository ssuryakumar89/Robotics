Questions
==================

1) Assign1 - This assignment is to use Reinforcement Learning to solve the following "Windy Grid World" problem
             http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~robplatt/hw1.html
             
2) Assign2 - This assignment is to solve two LQR problems.
             http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~robplatt/hw2.html
             
3) Assign3 - This homework assignment is to solve a motion planning problem for a two-link robot arm once using PRM and              RRT.
             http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~robplatt/hw3.html
             
4) Assign4 - This homework assignment is to use a histogram filter to partially localize the robot.
             http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~robplatt/hw4.html
            
5) Assign5 - This homework assignment is to use a particle filter to localize the position of the robot.
             http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~robplatt/hw5.html
             
6) Project - Comparison between Kalman Filtering and Parricle filtering for localization and tracking of a robot in a 2D              planar environment
